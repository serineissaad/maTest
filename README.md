- Please find the main code in the solution notebook.
- The pix2struct-cad-model-light folder contains the saved model, called for evalution.
- The enhacements/bottlenecks are in the bottom of the notebook.

7 hours would've been more than enough to get an **optimized** model, if training was on a VM.

**Thank you for the test ~~**
